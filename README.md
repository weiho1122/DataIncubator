#project description
From scraping EIA continental US power consumption data by states from year 2008 to 2015, total power consumption across continental US by states by season by year was plotted using Bokeh. Data was preprocessed in excel to format structure, gif was generated in photoshop (later to be animated in code).
The result shows geographic and chronographic evolution of energy consumed in continental US for the last 7 years. Less energy consumed in east and west coast compared with central states, with significant seasonal variation in these areas. Summer energy consumption yields higher in southern states and Winter the opposite.
Further analysis should include energy types, correlation to policy, economics, dermographic change, public consensus over environment issues, etc..
